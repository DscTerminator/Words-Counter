# Words-Counter
A simple Python script that counts the number of words in a file

Run the 'main.py' file. When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the path of the file you want to analyze. The program will then display the word count of the file. Please make sure the file path is accurate and that you have the necessary read permissions for the file.
